for every point we have to place on grid:
	
	if there are no points on the grid already:
		place that point ANYWHERE on the grid
		AND 
		add that point name to the monitoring_constraint list

	else there are already points on the grid:
		check that those points adhere to constraint:
			if they don't:
				try and constrain them

			else:
				place point randomly on grid
				add that point name to the monitoring_constraint list
